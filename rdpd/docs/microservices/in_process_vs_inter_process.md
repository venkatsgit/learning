| Performance  | - Faster and more efficient, as data is passed through buffers instead of row by row. - No network overhead or latency involved. - Example: The producer and consumer problem using shared memory1. | - Slower and less efficient, as data is serialized and deserialized across processes. - Network overhead and latency can affect performance. - Example: The client and server model using message passing2. |
| Reliability  | - More prone to errors and failures, as processes share the same address space and resources. - A crash or deadlock in one process can affect the whole system. - Example: A memory leak or corruption in one process can cause the system to crash3. | - More resilient and fault-tolerant, as processes are isolated and independent. - A crash or failure in one process can be handled by another process. - Example: A service bus can route messages to alternative services in case of failures4.            |
| Complexity   | - Simpler and easier to implement, as processes can communicate directly using function calls or shared variables. - No need for synchronization or coordination protocols. - Example: A simple function call like send(p1, message) can communicate with another process2. | - More complex and harder to implement, as processes need to establish and maintain communication links using sockets, pipes, or mailboxes. - Need for synchronization and coordination protocols. - Example: A complex message structure like send(A, message) can communicate with another process using a mailbox2. |
