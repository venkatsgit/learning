**Situations Where Microservices Might Not Work Well:**

**Brand-New Products or Startups:**

Challenge: Constant changes in the domain during the early stages make defining stable service boundaries challenging.
Caution: Coordination across evolving service boundaries can be expensive.

**Limited Resources in Startups:**

Challenge: Microservices introduce new complexities and work, which can be overwhelming for smaller teams.
Caution: Microservices may demand bandwidth that smaller teams can't afford.

**Customer-Managed Software:**

Challenge: Microservices add deployment and operational complexity, which may not be feasible for customers managing the software.
Caution: Expecting customers to handle the intricacies of technologies like Kubernetes may lead to user dissatisfaction.



**Scenarios Where Microservices Work Well:**

**Enhanced Developer Independence:**

Benefit: Microservices allow more developers to work independently, reducing delivery contention.
Example: A growing organization with a large development team benefits from independent service development.

**Software as a Service (SaaS) Applications:**

Benefit: Independent releasability of microservices suits SaaS applications requiring 24-7 operation.
Example: Cloud-based services benefit from scalable and individually releasable microservices.

**Cloud Platform Optimization:**

Benefit: Microservices leverage cloud platforms effectively, matching specific services to suitable cloud services.
Example: Deploying services using various cloud mechanisms like functions, managed VMs, or PaaS platforms.

**Flexibility for Digital Transformation:**

Benefit: Microservices offer flexibility for evolving systems and unlocking functionality for new customer experiences.
Example: Organizations undergoing digital transformation can adapt to changing interaction mechanisms.

**Future-Proofing and Flexibility:**

Benefit: Microservices provide flexibility for evolving systems and accommodate future changes.
Example: Keeping options open for changes in technology and architecture.
