**Pitfalls of Monoliths**

    1. Scalability Challenges:
    Monoliths can be challenging to scale as a whole, often requiring duplication of the entire application.
    2. Technology Homogeneity:
    Limited flexibility in choosing technologies, as the entire monolith must adhere to a single tech stack.
    3. Difficulty in Deployment:
    Updating a monolith may necessitate redeploying the entire application, leading to downtime.
