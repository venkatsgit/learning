**Single-Process Monolith**
Description: In a single-process monolith, the entire application is deployed as a single, tightly coupled unit.
Example: A traditional web application built with a monolithic architecture, where the frontend, backend, and database are all part of the same deployment unit. Changes to any component may require redeploying the entire application.

**Modular Monolith**
Description: In a modular monolith, the application is still a monolith, but it is structured as separate modules that can be worked on independently.
Example: An e-commerce platform where different modules handle product catalog, user authentication, and order processing. Each module can be developed and deployed independently, but they are combined into a single unit during deployment.

**Distributed Monolith**
Description: A distributed monolith consists of multiple services, but these services are tightly coupled, and the entire system must be deployed together.
Example: Consider an enterprise application with distinct services for user management, inventory, and billing. However, changes in one service may have cascading effects on others, and deploying any change requires deploying the entire set of services together.
These examples illustrate the evolution from a tightly integrated single-process monolith to a more modular approach and then the challenges introduced by a distributed monolith, where services might lack true independence. Each has its advantages and trade-offs in terms of development, deployment, and maintenance.
