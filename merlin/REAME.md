# MERLIN

## The Problem

Today's e-commerce operations are fragmented. One team checks marketing dashboards. Another toggles inventory reports. A third tracks orders and sales. **Insights are siloed, decisions are slow, and opportunities slip through the cracks.**

Whether it's a brand manager, merchandiser, or category lead â€” they typically juggle at least **three disconnected systems**, sift through multiple reports, and manually compile notes or spreadsheets before making a single business decision.
